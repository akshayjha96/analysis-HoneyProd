  <h1>Honey Production Data Analysis</h1>
  <p>This Jupyter notebook contains a data analysis of the honey production dataset. The dataset contains information about honey production in the United States from 1995 to 2021. The notebook uses Pandas and Matplotlib to explore the data and answer some questions about honey production in the United States.</p>
  <p>The following questions are answered in the notebook:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>What are the top 5 honey producing states in the United States?</li>
    <li>How has honey production changed over time?</li>
    <li>What are the factors that affect honey production?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The notebook also includes some visualizations of the data. These visualizations can be used to answer the questions above and to gain a better understanding of honey production in the United States.</p>
  <p>To run the code in this notebook, you will need to install Python and the following libraries:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Pandas</li>
    <li>Matplotlib</li>
    <li>Seaborn</li>
    <li>Numpy</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Once you have installed the libraries, you can open the Jupyter notebook viewer and navigate to the directory containing the notebook. You can then open the notebook and run the code.</p>
  <p>The following is a list of the attributes and information about the data:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Year</li>
    <li>State</li>
    <li>Production (pounds)</li>
    <li>Price (per pound)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This dataset was collected by the United States Department of Agriculture and made available to the public. The dataset can be found on the USDA website.</p>
  <p>If you have any questions about this notebook, please contact the author at <a href="mailto:[email protected]">[email protected]</a>.</p>
  <p>Here are some observations from the data analysis:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>California is the top honey producing state in the United States.</li>
    <li>Honey production has increased over time.</li>
    <li>The price of honey has fluctuated over time.</li>
  </ul>
